| Task | Status |
| --- |  --- |
| Connect feedback form to backend | Done ✔️ |
| Display student's feedback history | In progress 50% |

| Connect student profile to backend | Done ✔️ |
| Basic edit functionality | In Progress ✔️ |

### ⏳ IF TIME REMAINS: Quick Wins

**Task 4.1: Basic Error Handling**
| Task | Status |
| --- |  --- |
| Add toast notifications for key actions | Pending ⏳ |
| Loading states for all forms | Done ✔️ |

**Task 4.2: Simple Messaging Setup**  
| Task | Status |
| --- |  --- |
| Basic Socket.io connection (no advanced features) | Pending ⏳ |
| Simple message send/receive | Pending ⏳ |

## 🎯 ABSOLUTE MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP)

**Complete These 6 Tasks for Functional App:**

1. ✅ Student Login → Dashboard (with real data)
2. ✅ Student Book Session → Success confirmation  
3. ✅ Student View/Cancel Sessions
4. ✅ Psychiatrist Login → Manage Sessions
5. ✅ Psychiatrist View Booked Sessions
6. ✅ Basic Feedback Submission

## 🔧 TECHNICAL PRIORITIES:

### Redux Setup (1 hour max):
```javascript
// Essential slices only:
- authSlice (user, token, role)
- studentSlice (sessions, bookings, profile)
- psychiatristSlice (sessions, availability)
```

### Protected Routes (30 minutes):
- Simple role-based route protection
- Redirect unauthorized users

### API Integration Pattern:
```javascript
// Use this pattern for ALL integrations:
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState('');

const handleAction = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const response = await api.call();
    // Update state/redux
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err.message);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

## 🚫 WHAT TO SKIP TODAY:

- ❌ Advanced messaging features
- ❌ Calendar integration  
- ❌ Profile picture upload
- ❌ Complex filtering
- ❌ Video chat
- ❌ Advanced notifications

## 📋 QUICK CHECKLIST FOR TODAY:

**Morning (9AM-12PM):**
- [ ] Student auth + dashboard integration
- [ ] Booking system integration
- [ ] Session management integration

**Afternoon (1PM-4PM):**
- [ ] Psychiatrist auth + dashboard
- [ ] Basic feedback system
- [ ] Profile integration

**Evening (4PM-6PM):**
- [ ] Error handling & loading states
- [ ] Basic testing & bug fixes
- [ ] Deployment preparation

## 🆘 EMERGENCY FALLBACK:

If running out of time, focus on **Student Journey Only**:
1. Student Login → Book Session → View Sessions
2. Make psychiatrist features mock data

**Questions to clarify:**
1. Which backend endpoints are already tested and working?
2. Do you have a deployment plan for today?
3. Any specific presentation requirements?

You can do this! Focus on the critical path and make the core features work end-to-end.

### **Week 2 (Management)**
4. User Management (Edit/Delete/Status)
5. Payment Transactions View

8. Support Ticket System
9. Reporting & Export

### **Week 4 (Polish)**
10. Audit Logs
11. System Settings
12. Bulk Operations

---

## **TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Database Indexes Needed:**
```
✅ Users: email, role, createdAt, status
✅ Sessions: date, status, studentId, psychiatristId
✅ Payments: status, createdAt, userId
✅ Admin Logs: adminId, action, timestamp
```

### **Security Considerations:**
- Rate limiting for admin endpoints
- IP whitelisting for super admin actions
- Two-factor authentication for admin login
- Session timeouts for admin panel

### **Performance Optimizations:**
- Redis caching for admin dashboard data
- Pagination for all list endpoints
- Database query optimization
- Background jobs for reports

---

## **API VERSIONING**
```
Use: /api/v1/admin/...
All endpoints should be versioned
Admin API separate from user API
```

## **TESTING CHECKLIST**
```
✅ Unit tests for admin middleware
✅ Integration tests for all admin endpoints
✅ Security penetration testing
✅ Performance load testing
```

## **DOCUMENTATION NEEDED**
```
✅ Swagger documentation for all admin endpoints
✅ Admin user guide
✅ API rate limits documentation
✅ Error handling guide
```

---

## **NEXT STEPS AFTER BACKEND**

Once backend is complete:
1. **Frontend Admin Dashboard**
2. **Real-time notifications** (WebSocket for admin panel)
3. **Admin mobile app** (optional)
4. **Automated reporting** (scheduled emails)

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 weeks for full implementation

**Recommendation:** Start with Phase 1 (Admin Auth) and implement incrementally, testing each phase thoroughly before moving to the next. Use feature flags for new admin features.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section or provide code templates for any of these tasks?
