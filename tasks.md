    - Implement Phase 8 + Phase 9 (messaging - your key feature)
    - Complete remaining phases for full functionality

Key Considerations:
    - Test backend APIs with each frontend feature
    - Implement responsive design throughout
    - Add proper loading states from the beginning
    - Consider accessibility in all components
