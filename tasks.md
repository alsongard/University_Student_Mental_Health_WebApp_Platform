    - Implement Phase 8 + Phase 9 (messaging - your key feature)
    - Complete remaining phases for full functionality

Key Considerations:
    - Test backend APIs with each frontend feature
    - Implement responsive design throughout
    - Add proper loading states from the beginning
    - Consider accessibility in all components

## URGENT: Final Day Task Prioritization

Based on your progress and today's deadline, here's the **critical path** to completion:

### 🚨 PHASE 1: BACKEND INTEGRATION (MOST CRITICAL - 4-5 hours)

**Task 1.1: Student Authentication Integration**
- Connect login form to backend API
- Handle JWT token storage (redux/localStorage)
- Set up protected route wrapper

**Task 1.2: Student Dashboard Data Integration**
- Fetch and display real student data
- Connect overview cards to actual stats
- Implement loading states

**Task 1.3: Booking System Integration**
- Connect booking form to backend API
- Handle booking success/error states
- Update available sessions dynamically

**Task 1.4: Session Management Integration**
- Connect "My Sessions" to real API data
- Implement session cancellation functionality
- Display real session history

### 🚨 PHASE 2: PSYCHIATRIST DASHBOARD (3-4 hours)

**Task 2.1: Psychiatrist Authentication**
- Quick login integration
- Role-based routing

**Task 2.2: Basic Psychiatrist Dashboard**
- Connect session management to backend
- Implement create/edit/delete sessions
- Display booked sessions with student details

### 🚨 PHASE 3: CORE FEATURES (2-3 hours)

**Task 3.1: Feedback System Integration**
- Connect feedback form to backend
- Display student's feedback history
- Basic rating display

**Task 3.2: Profile Management**
- Connect student profile to backend
- Basic edit functionality

### ⏳ IF TIME REMAINS: Quick Wins

**Task 4.1: Basic Error Handling**
- Add toast notifications for key actions
- Loading states for all forms

**Task 4.2: Simple Messaging Setup**
- Basic Socket.io connection (no advanced features)
- Simple message send/receive

## 🎯 ABSOLUTE MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP)

**Complete These 6 Tasks for Functional App:**

1. ✅ Student Login → Dashboard (with real data)
2. ✅ Student Book Session → Success confirmation  
3. ✅ Student View/Cancel Sessions
4. ✅ Psychiatrist Login → Manage Sessions
5. ✅ Psychiatrist View Booked Sessions
6. ✅ Basic Feedback Submission

## 🔧 TECHNICAL PRIORITIES:

### Redux Setup (1 hour max):
```javascript
// Essential slices only:
- authSlice (user, token, role)
- studentSlice (sessions, bookings, profile)
- psychiatristSlice (sessions, availability)
```

### Protected Routes (30 minutes):
- Simple role-based route protection
- Redirect unauthorized users

### API Integration Pattern:
```javascript
// Use this pattern for ALL integrations:
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState('');

const handleAction = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const response = await api.call();
    // Update state/redux
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err.message);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

## 🚫 WHAT TO SKIP TODAY:

- ❌ Advanced messaging features
- ❌ Calendar integration  
- ❌ Profile picture upload
- ❌ Complex filtering
- ❌ Video chat
- ❌ Advanced notifications

## 📋 QUICK CHECKLIST FOR TODAY:

**Morning (9AM-12PM):**
- [ ] Student auth + dashboard integration
- [ ] Booking system integration
- [ ] Session management integration

**Afternoon (1PM-4PM):**
- [ ] Psychiatrist auth + dashboard
- [ ] Basic feedback system
- [ ] Profile integration

**Evening (4PM-6PM):**
- [ ] Error handling & loading states
- [ ] Basic testing & bug fixes
- [ ] Deployment preparation

## 🆘 EMERGENCY FALLBACK:

If running out of time, focus on **Student Journey Only**:
1. Student Login → Book Session → View Sessions
2. Make psychiatrist features mock data

**Questions to clarify:**
1. Which backend endpoints are already tested and working?
2. Do you have a deployment plan for today?
3. Any specific presentation requirements?

You can do this! Focus on the critical path and make the core features work end-to-end.
